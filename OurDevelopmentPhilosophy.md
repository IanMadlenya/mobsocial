**Our Development Philosophy**

1. Avoid Null Values, use default values/objects instead.
2. Follow .NET naming guidelines
3. Continuous Improvement/Refactoring
4. Use technologies that are easy to use and most are familiar with such as HTML, Javascript, and CSS.
5. Automate Everything: Continuous Integration, Builds, Deployment, Installation, everything
6. No code duplications. Create reusable components and encapsulate common logic
7. Most important, Have Fun!
